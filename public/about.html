<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  I’m a passionate and curious learner who enjoys building meaningful things
  with technology. I love exploring ideas, understanding how systems work, and
  turning concepts into real, working projects. Whether it’s developing
  applications, learning new tools, or improving my problem-solving skills, I’m
  driven by the excitement of creating something that makes life a little easier
  or more interesting.

<p>
  Over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in software and web development,
  constantly experimenting, breaking things, and learning from them. I enjoy
  combining creativity with logic—designing clean user experiences while also
  focusing on efficiency and functionality. I believe growth comes from
  continuous learning, and I’m always looking for opportunities, projects, and
  collaborations that challenge me to level up.

<p>
  Beyond academics and work, I value curiosity, discipline, and honest effort. I
  enjoy sharing what I learn, helping others when I can, and steadily building a
  career that aligns with both my skills and values. My journey is still in
  progress, and I’m excited about the paths ahead and the projects I’ve yet to
  create.
