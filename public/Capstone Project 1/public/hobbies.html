    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
      I enjoy reading non-fiction and personal development books, which helps me
      stay curious and continuously learn new perspectives. I also like
      listening to podcasts related to technology, productivity, and personal
      growth. These hobbies help me stay updated, improve my focus, and develop
      a growth mindset.

    <p>
      I am passionate about fitness activities such as walking, light workouts,
      and playing outdoor sports with friends. Regular physical activity keeps
      me energetic, disciplined, and motivated. It has also helped me develop
      teamwork and perseverance, which I apply in my academic and professional
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I like exploring new tools, apps, and simple tech
      projects out of curiosity. I enjoy organizing tasks, planning my week, and
      learning new skills online. These hobbies have strengthened my
      problem-solving ability, creativity, and comfort with technology. If you’d
      like, tell me your real hobbies and I can tailor these exactly to you or
      your specific job profile.
